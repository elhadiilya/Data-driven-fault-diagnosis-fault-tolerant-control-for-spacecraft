# Data-driven-fault-diagnosis-fault-tolerant-control-for-spacecraft
# This repository is dedicated for codes (MATLAB or Python) used for model-free methods
# designed for fault diagnostics (FDI) and fault tolerant control (FTC) of spacecraft
# Faults may affect attitude sensors like gyroscopes or MAG, actuators like reaction wheels or thrusters.
# Many machine learning algorithms exist for data classification and clustring.
